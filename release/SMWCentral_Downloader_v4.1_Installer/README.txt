SMWCentral Downloader & Patcher v4.1

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract both files to the same folder
2. Run "SMWC Downloader.exe" to start the application
3. DO NOT run "SMWC Updater.exe" directly - it's used automatically for updates

WHAT'S NEW IN v4.1:
• Fixed PyInstaller update restart mechanism
• Added standalone updater to prevent Python DLL errors
• Improved update process reliability
• Enhanced error handling during updates

IMPORTANT NOTES:
• Both executables must be in the same folder for updates to work
• The updater runs automatically when you update the application
• You only need to run "SMWC Downloader.exe" to start the program
