### Emulator Configuration

The app supports launching ROMs directly in your favorite emulator with one click!

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Go to Settings** → **Emulator Configuration**
2. **Browse for your emulator executable**:
   - **Windows**: Select the `.exe` file (e.g., `snes9x-x64.exe`, `retroarch.exe`)
   - **macOS**: Select the `.app` bundle (e.g., `Snes9x.app`) - the app will automatically find the executable inside
   - **Linux**: Select the binary (e.g., `/usr/bin/snes9x-gtk`, `/usr/games/retroarch`)
3. **Optional: Add command-line arguments**
   - Check "Use Custom Command Line Arguments"
   - Enter your desired arguments (see examples below)
4. **Save and test**: The play icon (▶) will appear next to downloaded hacks in your Collection

#### Command-Line Arguments Examples

**RetroArch (Windows):**
```
-L cores/snes9x_libretro.dll "%1"
```

**RetroArch (macOS):**
- Emulator Path: `/Applications/RetroArch.app/Contents/MacOS/RetroArch`
- Command Line Arguments:
```
-L "~/Library/Application Support/RetroArch/cores/snes9x_libretro.dylib" "%1"
```

**RetroArch (Linux):**
```
-L ~/.config/retroarch/cores/snes9x_libretro.so "%1"
```

**Snes9x:**
```
--fullscreen
```

**Custom Arguments:**
- Use `%1` as a placeholder for the ROM file path
- If you don't use `%1`, the ROM will be automatically added at the end
- Arguments are parsed with proper quote handling

#### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows:**
- Browse for `.exe` files
- Emulator runs without console window

**macOS:**
- Browse for `.app` bundles (e.g., `Snes9x.app`, `RetroArch.app`)
- The app automatically converts `.app` paths to the actual executable inside
- Example: `Snes9x.app` → `Snes9x.app/Contents/MacOS/Snes9x`

**Linux:**
- Browse for binaries in `/usr/bin/`, `/usr/games/`, or custom locations
- Make sure the binary has execute permissions
- Folder picker dialogs use the native system chooser (GTK/KDE portal) instead of the built-in Tk widget, giving you a proper vertical-scroll file browser on both X11 and Wayland

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Windows Security Warning
Windows may show "Windows protected your PC" when running the app. This is normal for new applications. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" to continue.

### Mac Security Warning
macOS may say the app is from an "unidentified developer." Right-click the app → "Open" → "Open" to bypass this. You only need to do this once.

### Linux: App Won't Start
If the app won't launch, install these packages:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install tkinter`

### Can't Find Downloaded ROMs
Check the folder path shown in Settings. By default, ROMs are saved to:
- **Windows**: `Desktop\SMWCentral Hacks\`
- **Mac**: `Desktop/SMWCentral Hacks/`
- **Linux**: `~/Desktop/SMWCentral Hacks/`

### Emulator Won't Launch
If clicking the play icon doesn't work:
1. **Check emulator path**: Go to Settings → Emulator Configuration and verify the path is correct
2. **macOS users**: Make sure you selected the `.app` file, not the executable inside
3. **Check arguments**: Disable "Use Custom Command Line Arguments" to test without arguments first
4. **Test manually**: Try launching your emulator with a ROM file manually to ensure it works
5. **Check logs**: Go to Settings page and check the log output for error messages

## 📝 What You Need

- **Your Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or modern Linux
- **A clean SMW ROM**: Unmodified Super Mario World ROM file (.smc or .sfc)
- **Storage space**: About 20 MB for the app, plus space for your ROM collection
- **Internet connection**: Required for downloading hacks and app updates
- **Optional - Emulator**: Any SNES emulator (Snes9x, RetroArch, bsnes, etc.) for the quick-launch feature
