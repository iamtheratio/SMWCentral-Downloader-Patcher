## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows
**Antivirus/Windows Defender blocking the app?**
- Run the included `defender_exclusion.bat` script as Administrator
- Manually add the application folder to Windows Defender exclusions
- This is a common false positive with PyInstaller executables

**Application won't start?**
- Make sure you have the latest Windows updates
- Try running as administrator
- Verify you have Windows 10 (1903+) or Windows 11

#### macOS
**"Cannot open because it is from an unidentified developer"?**
- Right-click the app ‚Üí Select "Open" ‚Üí Click "Open" in the dialog
- This only needs to be done once for unsigned applications
- The app is safe but not code-signed (requires Apple Developer account)

**App won't launch from Applications?**
- Try launching from terminal: `open "/Applications/SMWC Downloader.app"`
- Check Console.app for any error messages
- Ensure you have macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or newer

#### Linux
**Missing dependencies?**
- Install required packages: `sudo apt install python3-tkinter libgtk-3-0` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- For other distributions, use equivalent packages through your package manager
- Ensure you have a modern GTK-based desktop environment

**Permission denied when running?**
- Make sure the executable has proper permissions: `chmod +x "SMWC Downloader"`
- Run from terminal to see any error messages: `./SMWC\ Downloader`

### Common Cross-Platform Issues

**Downloads not working?**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the hack is still available on SMWCentral
- Make sure you have write permissions to the output directory
- Check firewall settings aren't blocking the application

**Patches failing?**
- Ensure your base ROM is a clean, unmodified Super Mario World ROM
- Check that you have enough disk space
- Verify the ROM file isn't corrupted
- Make sure the ROM file format is .smc or .sfc

**Updates not working?**
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Check that your antivirus/firewall isn't blocking the update process
- Try manually checking for updates from Settings
- Restart the application if update checks seem stuck
- On Linux, ensure the application directory has write permissions
