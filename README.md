## üóÇÔ∏è File Organization

```
/Output Folder
  /Kaizo
    /01 - Newcomer/
    /02 - Casual/
    /07 - Grandmaster/
    /08 - No Difficulty/    # For unrated hacks
  /Standard
    /01 - Newcomer/

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The app saves settings in `config.json`:
```json
{
  "base_rom_path": "path/to/clean.smc",
  "output_dir": "path/to/output",
  "api_delay": 0.8
}
```

**API Delay Slider**: Adjust if experiencing rate limiting (higher = slower but more reliable)

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Clean Super Mario World ROM file
- Internet connection for SMWC API

## üÜï What's New in v2.5

- **"Include Waiting" Filter**: Option to download hacks pending moderation
- **Log Controls**: Clear button and Ctrl+L shortcut for easy log management
- **Improved Pagination**: Fixed pagination issues with large result sets
- **Unified Color System**: Centralized color management for theme consistency
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatic handling of duplicate entries
- **Enhanced API Delay**: More precise control with cleaner 0.1 increments
- **Better User Feedback**: Improved logging for waiting and moderated hacks

## üîß Technical Notes

**"No Difficulty" Processing**: Due to SMWC API limitations, selecting "No Difficulty" downloads ALL hacks then filters locally. This takes longer but finds hacks that weren't properly categorized.

**"Include Waiting" Option**: Fetches both moderated hacks and those pending moderation. Provides access to the newest submissions.

**File Formats**: Supports .smc/.sfc ROMs and .ips/.bps patches with automatic header detection.

## üì¶ Building from Source

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**Dependencies**: `tkinter`, `requests`, `sv-ttk`, `pywinstyles`
