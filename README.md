### How the Auto-Updater Works
The application includes a sophisticated update system designed to be safe and user-friendly:

1. **Background Checking**: Every time you start the app, it quietly checks GitHub for new releases
2. **User Notification**: If an update is found, you'll see a popup with release notes and options
3. **Safe Download**: The update is downloaded to a temporary location and verified
4. **Backup & Replace**: Your current version is backed up before installing the new one
5. **Quick Restart**: The app closes and reopens with the new version (takes about 5-6 seconds total)
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary files and backups are cleaned up automatically

The updater is designed to be **completely safe** - if anything goes wrong during the update process, your original version will be automatically restored.
