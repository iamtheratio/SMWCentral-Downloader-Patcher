# History Page Multi-Type Support Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **History Page Details View Bug** ✅ FIXED
**File:** `ui/pages/history_page.py` (line 513)
**Problem:** The hack details popup was still showing only the single `hack_type` field instead of formatted multi-types.
**Fix:** Updated `_show_hack_details()` to use `format_types_display()` with the `hack_types` array.

### 2. **History Page Type Filter Bug** ✅ FIXED  
**File:** `ui/history_components.py` (line 421)
**Problem:** The type filter was only checking against the single `hack_type` field, so hacks with multiple types would only be found when filtering by their primary type.
**Fix:** Updated `_hack_passes_filters()` to check if the filter value matches ANY of the hack's types.

### 3. **Data Manager Missing Multi-Type Data** ✅ FIXED (ROOT CAUSE)
**File:** `hack_data_manager.py` (line 69)
**Problem:** The `get_all_hacks()` method was only returning the single `hack_type` field and NOT including the `hack_types` array, so the history page never received multi-type data.
**Fix:** Updated `get_all_hacks()` to include the `hack_types` field in the returned data.

**Before:**
```python
"hack_type": hack_data.get("hack_type", "unknown").title(),  # Capitalize for display
```

**After:**
```python  
"hack_type": hack_data.get("hack_type", "unknown").title(),  # Keep for backward compatibility
"hack_types": hack_data.get("hack_types", [hack_data.get("hack_type", "unknown")]),  # NEW: Include multi-type support
```

## Test Results

✅ **Import validation:** All modules import correctly without errors
✅ **Multi-type display:** `format_types_display(['standard', 'puzzle'])` correctly returns "Standard, Puzzle"
✅ **Filter logic:** Comprehensive testing confirms filtering works for:
   - Multi-type hacks (matches any of their types)
   - Single-type hacks (backward compatibility)
   - Old format hacks (fallback to single hack_type field)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **History Page Table:** Shows "Standard, Puzzle" in the Type column (already working from previous fix)
2. **History Page Details:** Shows "Type: Standard, Puzzle" in the popup details (now fixed)
3. **Type Filtering:** 
   - Filtering by "Standard" will find hacks with ["standard", "puzzle"] types
   - Filtering by "Puzzle" will find hacks with ["standard", "puzzle"] types  
   - Filtering by "Kaizo" will NOT find hacks with ["standard", "puzzle"] types

The user should now be able to:
- See "Standard, Puzzle" displayed in both the table and details view for the Reverie hack
- Find the Reverie hack when filtering by Type = "Standard" 
- Find the Reverie hack when filtering by Type = "Puzzle"
